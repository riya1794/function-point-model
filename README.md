FPA - Function Point Analysis is one of the best methods for measuring functional size of a software. It is defined within the IFPUG FSM Method. 

The FPA principles were introduced in 1979 by Alan Albrecht and his IBM colleagues. Then IBM waived the copright making FPA public and available to anyone and in 1986 IFPUG has been chartered. IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group) is a non-profit organization which promotes and encourages use of Function Points. 

In general FPA helps develop consistent and accurate counting guidelines and maintains Public Standard for Sizing Software (CPM). 
Function Point Analysis is a consistent, standardized method for measuring the functionality delivered to an end user. Although it's available at the early project's development stage, it provides acceptable and meaningful level of accuracy.
